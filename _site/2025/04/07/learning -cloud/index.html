    <p>This is the first post on learning cloud computing. My experience so far with AWS cloud computing has been awesome. I began learning about the AWS cloud on the skill builder site, which has many trainings which can help you get certified on AWS skills. The first training involved getting familiar with the AWS cloud, and its important services it offers. I began this training in 2023. After studying for 6 or 8 months, I took the AWS cloud practitioner exam and passed it. It was great.</p>
<p>Today in 2025, I'm using the AWS cloud to host some of my websites and have started to use a data pipeline from github to my AWS S3 bucket which hosts my site. I will continue to build more web apps and use a similar data pipeline to automate the process.</p>
