This is the first post on the blog detailing my journey in software development. I'm currently learning full stack webdevelopment mostly with nodejs, but also trying out python web development. I'm also learning about machine learning with python and using the AWS cloud to host my projects
and using their services. Regarding AWS cloud services, I've used their storage S3 buckets, dynamodb database, and have managed to start a data pipeline from my website to github and deploying it on AWS S2 bucket. I hope I can continue to write blog posts since I've never been a writer type.
